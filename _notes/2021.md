so i formatted my laptop again, and this time i am going for the generic programmer setup.

i installed ubuntu 20.04, which i had always despised and called it the ***windows of linux***.
and i also started using **VSCode**.

yea, i know right! but i still have vim 8.2 installed and setup with all my configs saved in the [vimrc](https://github.com/thenerdsuperuser/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc).

i guess this decade is going to see a lot of changes, positive i hope.
