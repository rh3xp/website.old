So I created a new organization called [Learn X Today](https://learn.thenerdsuperuser.xyz). Actually I made it 4 days ago, but I created a subdomain on my main website today. Just finished enforcing https after the TLS certificate got verified.   

The main reason for creating this org is to create repositories which give a brief tutorial on a module/library/framework which I learn, and also shows a demo project which I implement.   

You know, just dabbling with stuff.
