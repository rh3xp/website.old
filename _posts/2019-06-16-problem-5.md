So, factorial is pretty basic and the most important thing to learn when you are doing recursion. Just multiply `n` with `n-1` until it reaches 1.


``` c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int factorial(int n)
{
    if (n == 0) 
        return 1; 
    return n * factorial(n - 1); 
}

int main() {
	int num, fact;
	cin >> num;	
	fact = factorial(num);
	cout << fact;
}
```
