## Front-end

### Jekyll Themes
* Build a [new Jekyll theme](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue) from a single-page web template written in HTML5, Sass, and JavaScript
* Design an [intuitive, well-documented API](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue/blob/master/README.md) for building a homepage with this theme
* Extend the web template to multiple pages to meet Jekyll users' blogging needs
* Favor universal access by changing banner image content from CSS `background-image` to `<img>` tags with alt text, scaled with `object-fit`
* Make SEO easy by piping users' config variables to meta tags with Liquid templating

### React
* [Migrate](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/react-auth-sandbox) a single-page app's client-side routing from React Router 3 to 4
* Follow best practices in React with views in a component hierarchy where [data flows down](https://reactjs.org/docs/thin king-in-react.html)
* Take full advantage of React before carefully adding Redux

-----------------

## Full Stack

### Java
* Implement the Model-View-Controller pattern in a full-stack web app
* Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to describe database structure
* Use a DAO interface to send prepared statements to a PostgreSQL database

### Google, Udacity
* Win a [scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google) (Jan. to April 2018) to learn full stack mobile-first development techniques and patterns (such as offline-first for slow connections)

### WordPress
* Deploy WordPress manually to Heroku and connect it to an Amazon RDS instance running MySQL. (I later [switched](http://www.mild-mandarin.com/) to GreenGeeks because Heroku's ephemeral file system isn't best suited for WordPress.)
* Configure SSL between the database and Heroku with keys and passwords stored in Heroku Config Variables
* [Deploy WordPress](http://www.mild-mandarin.com/) using a hosting provider such as GreenGeeks

-----------------

## Object-oriented Programming

* I work equally well with class-based inheritance (e.g., Java) and JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.
* I know how ES6's illusion of class-based inheritance works under the hood.
* I can [build a car](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/java-car) from scratch with Java classes and interfaces:

-----------------

## Other

### I make myself more productive with code
* I use the Gmail API to [keep my mail neat](https://gist.github.com/chrisbobbe/072add64f2254c7a22b21b77eceb874c)
* I made a [custom TypeScript app in IFTTT](https://gist.github.com/chrisbobbe/4d2f79af65efdfa31e49bf00f983c779) that connects my Fitbit with the productivity tracker Beeminder to make sure I sleep enough

### I did a 12-week batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), writing code full-time
* I grew by immersion in conversations beyond my level
* I learned to [ask good questions and push myself](https://www.recurse.com/manual)
* I spent lots of time learning JavaScript properly (ES5 and ES6)
* I pair programmed on a [Fortune's Algorithm (Voronoi diagram) implementation in C++](https://github.com/mtn/voronoi) for three weeks
* I studied machine learning theory

### Well-rounded formal education:
* [B.A., English, Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/english) with three CS classes
* [High School Diploma, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](https://www.ncssm.edu/)
